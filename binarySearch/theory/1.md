# Binary Search

Binary serach is a searching algorithm that operates on a sorted dividing it into halves to find a target value. your time is O(log N)

## Condition to apply binary search

1. the data structure must be sorted
2. access to some element should take constan time

## Binary Search Algorithm

I will start discribe the step-by-step algorithm
