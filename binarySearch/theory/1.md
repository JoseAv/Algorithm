# Binary Search

Binary serach is a searching algorithm that operates on a sorted dividing it into halves to find a target value. your time is O(log N)

## Condition to apply binary search

1. the data structure must be sorted
2. access to some element should take constan time

## Binary Search Algorithm

I will start discribe the step-by-step algorithm


1. Divide the search into two halves by finding the middle index "mid".
2. Compare the middle element of the search space with the key.
3. If the key is found at middle element, the procees is terminated.
4. If the key isn't at middle element, choose witch half will be used as the next serch space.
    * If the key is smaller than the middle element, then the left side is used.
    * If the key is larget than the middle element, then the rigth side is used.
5. This process is continued until the key is found or the total serach space is exhausted.

## how to implement Binary Search

you can implemented in the in the following two ways.
- Iterative binary search.
- Recursive binary search.
