# Introduction to Recursion

The process in which a function call itself directly or inderectly is called recursion.

- A recursive algorithm takes one step toward solution and then recursively call itself.

- Since called fuction may firther call itself. This process might continue forever.

## Steps to implemente recursion

1. Define a base case: This is the stopping condition for the recursion.
2. Define the problem in terms of smaller subproblems. Break the problem down into smaller version of itself.
3. Ensure the recusion terminates.
4. Combine the solution.


## Direct recursive

A fuction is called direct recursive if it call itself during its execution. The function makes a recursive call to itself within its own body.

## Inderect recursive
it is one that calls another fuction, and that other function, in turn, call the original function either directly or through other fuctions.
