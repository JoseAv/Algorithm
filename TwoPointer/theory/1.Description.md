# What it is?

It is a simple strategy where you use two indices(pointers)

# When yo use two pointers?
- ***Sorted input:*** if the array or list already sorted, you can find pairs or ranges.

- ***Pair or subArrays:*** When the problem asks about two elements, sub arrays, or ranges. for example if the string is palindromo

- ***Sliding Window problems:*** When you need to maintaint a windows of elements or a row elements based on a conditin

- ***Linked List (Slow-fast pointer):*** Detecting cycles, finding the middle node.

# how I know where The pointer has to start?

- ***Sorted input:*** Limits
- ***Linked List:*** Limits
- ***Windows:*** continuous 
- ***Pair or subArrays:***: Limits
